# MeXE402_Midterm_Atienza-Manalo
#### Both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are foundational techniques in machine learning used for different types of problems. While they share similarities in their structure, they are applied to distinct tasks and have different mathematical foundations. This repository will serve as our midterm exam that is designed to assess our understanding of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression through practical application on real-world datasets.

## Linear Regression
#### Introduction: Overview of Linear Regression.
Linear Regression
	Linear Regression is a key data science tool for predicting continuous outcomes. This guide explains its principles, uses, and how to implement it in Python with real data. It covers simple and multiple linear regression, highlighting their importance, limitations, and practical examples.  It finds the best line that minimizes the differences between predicted and actual values.

##### Explanation
#### Dataset:
  Salary Data Analysis
	This dataset contains information about salaries, years of experience, and other relevant factors. It's a suitable dataset for predicting salaries based on experience using linear regression.

##### Explanation

## Logistic Regression 
#### Introduction: Bank Marketing Dataset
##### Predicting Term Deposit Suscriptions
###### Find the best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign. How can the financial institution have a greater effectiveness for future marketing campaigns? In order to answer this, we have to analyze the last marketing campaign the bank performed and identify the patterns that will help us find conclusions in order to develop future strategies.
